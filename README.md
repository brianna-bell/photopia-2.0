# photopia-2.0

A 3D adventure recreating Adam Cadre's interactive fiction game Photopia. Adam Cadre can be found at http://adamcadre.ac/ and his game can be played at http://adamcadre.ac/if/photopia.html.
This is mostly to test my coding skills in C# and my ability to put together a fully functioning game.
